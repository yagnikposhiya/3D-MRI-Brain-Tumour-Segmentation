# 3D MRI Brain Tumour Segmentation using Box U-NET Architecture
Developed an architecture named Box-UNET, a variant of the UNET model. This architecture involved cross connections
to establish vital links between different levels in the standard UNET layers. Leveraging the **BrasTS2020 Dataset**, which
comprised MRI scans in nifti format. Research paper entitled with **Brain Tumor Image Segmentation using Box-Unet
Architecture** is accepted to the **International Conference on Advances in Electrical, Electronics, and Computational
Intelligence (ICAEECI 2023)** co-sponsored by **IEEE Xplore**, Tiruchengode, Tamilnadu, India.
